# DataLab3.7Activity4
Our datalab project from Olesea Placinta, Alta Wan, and Megan Zhang. In this project we connect and load the kiva loan database at kivaws.org/v1/loans/newest and use it to answer the question: What are the 3 most common categories for the newest loans that appear on the website?
